#The Lando's App

##Introduction

Each week, a member of the OpenSocial team, Dan Dumont, spends up to an hour
taking orders for a lunch run.

The Lando's app was built to satisfy two requirements:

1.) Provide an order management system for tracking lunch orders in order to
cut down on the time spent manually recording this information.

2.) Demonstrate the feasibility of writing an non-trivial application targeting an OpenSocial gadget.

##Libraries

- jQuery
- Backbone
- Bootstrap
- RequireJS
- Hogan

## Architecture

|__ Order

The Lando's app can function as both a webapp and a gadget. The goal was to
make the transition between these two formats seamless.
